# Privacy Policy for Kid Star

**Last Updated: February 9, 2026**

## Introduction

Kid Star ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of your children. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our personalized children's story generation app.

## Our Privacy-First Approach

Kid Star is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. We believe that your family's data should remain yours, which is why we've built the app to operate entirely on your device using Apple Intelligence.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

Kid Star does **NOT** collect, store, transmit, or share:

- Character names or any personally identifiable information you enter
- Story content generated by the app
- Generated illustrations or image descriptions
- User preferences or settings
- Device identifiers
- Location data
- Usage analytics or tracking data
- Contacts, photos, or other device data
- Any information about you or your children

## How the App Works

### On-Device Story Generation
- All story generation happens directly on your device using Apple Intelligence (on-device large language models)
- Character names, story preferences, and generated stories are stored locally in your device's secure storage
- No data is transmitted to external servers or third parties
- Your device's processing power and Apple's on-device AI handle all story creation

### On-Device Image Generation (Premium Feature)
For premium users with compatible devices (iOS 18.1+, iPadOS 18.1+, or macOS 15.1+ with Apple Intelligence):
- Story illustrations are generated using Apple's Image Playground technology
- All image generation happens entirely on your device using on-device AI models
- The app creates a short visual description (5-10 words) from your story's setting and theme
- **Character names and types are NOT included** in image descriptions to protect privacy
- Generated images are stored locally in your device's database alongside the story
- No images or descriptions are transmitted over the internet
- Image generation uses the same privacy-first approach as story generation

### Local Data Storage
- Stories, preferences, and images are stored using SwiftData in your device's local database
- Data is protected by your device's security features (encryption, Face ID/Touch ID, passcode)
- Only you can access this data through the app
- Data remains on your device and is included in your iCloud backup (if enabled) but is not accessible to us

## Image Playground Privacy Details

For users who choose to generate story illustrations:

### What Data is Used
- **Story metadata**: Settings, themes, and story type (e.g., "forest", "adventure", "bedtime")
- **AI-generated description**: A short 5-10 word description created from the story
- **NO character names**: Character names and types are intentionally excluded from all image generation
- **NO personal information**: No identifying information is used

### Where Processing Happens
- **100% On-Device**: All AI processing uses Apple's on-device Image Playground models
- **No Cloud Services**: Images are generated entirely on your device without internet connection
- **No External APIs**: No third-party image generation services are used
- **Local Storage Only**: Generated images are stored in your device's encrypted database

### Privacy by Design
- Image descriptions focus only on settings and atmosphere (e.g., "peaceful forest at sunset")
- Character-specific details are never included in image generation prompts
- This ensures illustrations are generic and cannot be associated with real individuals
- Images can be deleted at any time by deleting the story

### Apple Image Playground
- Image generation uses Apple's Image Playground technology
- Subject to Apple's privacy policies for on-device processing
- Apple does not collect or store any data from the image generation process
- See [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) for more information about Apple Intelligence

## Third-Party Services

Kid Star does **NOT** use:
- Analytics services
- Advertising networks
- Third-party data processors
- Cloud-based AI services
- External servers for any functionality

## In-App Purchases

If you choose to upgrade to Premium:
- Payment processing is handled entirely by Apple through the App Store
- We do not receive or store your payment information
- Apple's privacy policy governs payment transactions
- We only receive confirmation of purchase status from Apple (no personal details)

## Children's Privacy

Kid Star is specifically designed for use by parents and caregivers to create stories for children. We comply with children's privacy laws including COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act):

- The app does not collect any information from children
- The app does not enable children to share information
- There is no social networking or user-generated content sharing
- No data about children leaves your device
- Parents maintain complete control over all story content and character information

## Data Security

Your data security is paramount:
- All data remains on your device
- Data is protected by iOS/iPadOS/macOS security features
- No network transmission of personal information
- No external servers or databases that could be compromised

## iCloud Backup

If you have iCloud Backup enabled on your device:
- Your stories, illustrations, and app data may be included in your encrypted iCloud backup
- This backup is controlled by you and protected by Apple's security
- We do not have access to your iCloud data
- See Apple's privacy policy for information about iCloud security

## Your Rights and Control

You have complete control over your data:
- **Access**: All your data is accessible within the app
- **Deletion**: Delete individual stories or all app data by deleting the app
- **Export**: Export stories as PDF files that remain on your device
- **No Account**: No account or registration is required, so there's no profile to manage

## Email Support

If you contact us via email for support:
- We will only use your email address to respond to your inquiry
- Support emails are deleted after your issue is resolved
- We do not add email addresses to marketing lists
- We do not share email addresses with third parties

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes in:
- The app's features
- Legal requirements
- Best practices

When we make changes:
- The "Last Updated" date will be revised
- Significant changes will be communicated through the app
- Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance

## Legal Compliance

Kid Star complies with:
- Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- Other applicable privacy laws

As we do not collect any personal data, most data subject rights and obligations do not apply, as there is no data to access, correct, or delete on our end.

**Email**: support@littletiedisland.com

**Response Time**: We aim to respond within 48 hours

## Summary

**In Plain English:**
- Kid Star generates stories and illustrations entirely on your device using Apple Intelligence 
- The only time character names, stories, and images are ever sent to the developers is in the case that a user explicitly chooses "Send Feedback" about a story. Encrypted details of that story, including character names and ages, are encrypted sent to the developers
- Your family's privacy is important to us
